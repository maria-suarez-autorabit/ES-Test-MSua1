    <description>This field is automatically selected via formula. When selected it indicates a loan has met the state and status requirements that a financial institution considers to be closed funded. This allows insight into how many loans have closed, without having to check the actual loan stage. When disabled, a loan has not been closed funded. By default, it is unselected.</description>
